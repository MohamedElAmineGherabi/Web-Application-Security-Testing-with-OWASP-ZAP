# Web Application Security Testing with OWASP ZAP


<h2>Project Details</h2>
This lab focused on using OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) to explore and test web application security. The hands-on project provided a guided environment to simulate real-world scenarios, helping to build foundational skills in vulnerability scanning, proxy configuration, and web traffic analysis.<br />
<br />

**Tasks Breakdown:**

**Task 1: Introduction to OWASP ZAP**

Began with an overview of OWASP ZAP, its role in web application security, and its importance for penetration testers and security professionals. This step laid the groundwork for understanding the toolâ€™s capabilities.

**Task 2: Scanning a Website for Vulnerabilities**

Explored the OWASP ZAP interface and performed a basic vulnerability scan on a target website. This task demonstrated how to initiate scans and interpret the results.

**Task 3: Analyzing Scan Results and Generating Reports**

Reviewed the scan output to identify potential vulnerabilities. Generated a structured vulnerability report to summarize findings, which is essential for communicating risks to stakeholders.

**Task 4: Configuring FoxyProxy in Firefox**

Set up FoxyProxy, a Firefox extension, to route browser traffic through OWASP ZAP. This configuration enabled passive scanning of web traffic during normal browsing.

**Task 5: Discovering Hidden Files and Directories**

Used a dictionary list within OWASP ZAP to brute-force and discover hidden files and directories on the web server. This technique is useful for uncovering unlinked or sensitive resources.
<br />

**Key Takeaways:**

This lab enhanced my technical skills in using Wireshark for real-time network traffic analysis and detecting potential malicious activities. It provided practical experience in simulating network attacks and interpreting captured data, which is crucial for effective cybersecurity defense strategies. The ability to use Wireshark's powerful analysis tools prepares me for advanced network security monitoring and threat detection tasks.
